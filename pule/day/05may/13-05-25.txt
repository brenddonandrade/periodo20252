Diary: 13, May of 2025.

Hello myself of the future. Today, I did many things (as usual). Masters has been a busy period.
I came from the past to tell you that it was difficult, but I believe it will be worth it.
Without further ado...
At the beginning of the day, I made the material for my father to study for the contest. I hope he does well in this one. 
Next, I went to the gym and worked out my legs. It is very difficult for me. O prefer the train upper body workout.
Then, I went to college and study quantum computation. This is very different from undergraduate quantum.
Last, now I'm doing research, programming course work and studying English.
